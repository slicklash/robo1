:::tip[ROBO1 is an educational game for those who want to learn programming.]
I created it to introduce first-graders, my daughter's friends, to the computer programming profession.
The first version of the game was much simpler, suitable only for elementary school students.
But after gaining momentum, the game started to become more complicated and became much more interesting.
Therefore, ROBO1 is suitable for elementary school students, high school students and anyone who wants to learn programming.

I wish you good luck and most importantly - have fun!
